# Rick & Morty - JavaScript Frameworks

![RicknMorty](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/71260714/172363167-da7a9171-7ba1-42ca-95e7-84c218b3368c.jpg)

For my JavaScript Framework course assignment at Noroff spring semester 2022, we were tasked to create a React or Next app with API calls and login functionality. I chose to create a site with a Rick and Morty API, displaying it as a “Persons of Interest” site where you can find current info or contact the site with new info on the characters.

## Description
The goal was to create a site fetching information from an API and displaying it on the main page, with each item passing a parameter in the URL, linking to a details page. The site has a functional contact form with validation, and a login page with validation and redirecting to an admin page if login is successful. The login functionality requires a local installation of WordPress.
